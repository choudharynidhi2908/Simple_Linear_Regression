1) Calories_consumed-> predict weight gained using calories consumed

ANS :- lOG Model
2) Delivery_time -> Predict delivery time using sorting time

Exponential Transformation has Highest R2 value so we will use that model 

3) Emp_data -> Build a prediction model for Churn_out_rate 
4) Salary_hike -> Build a prediction model for Salary_hike

##R2 value of first model is nearby greater than  second model so first model is the best model


Do the necessary transformations for input variables for getting better R^2 value for the model prepared.
